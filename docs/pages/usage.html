<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>MojoBlog is incredibly easy to use, and it fits directly in with the rest of MojoMotor by providing a natural inline interface to creating and editing blog posts. When installed, MojoBlog will insert a new tab to the MojoBar called 'Blog'. Clicking on this will display the list of entries in your blog. This link will paginate after 10 entries. At the bottom of the list, you can see the <var>Create Entry</var> and <var>Categories</var> links. Inline in the table, there are two links to help manage your content; <var>Edit</var> and <var>Delete</var>. All these links are self-explanatory.</p>
